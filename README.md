Both the KDE and GNOME desktop environments have adopted a similar format for _"desktop entries"_, or configuration files describing how a particular program is to be launched, how it appears in menus, among other things. It is to the larger community's benefit that a unified standard be agreed upon by all parties such that interoperation between the two environments, and indeed any additional environments that implement the specification, becomes simpler.
